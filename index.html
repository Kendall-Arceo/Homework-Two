            <p1 class="lead">Welcome to my first web development page! I come from a non-traditional background for coding
                as I have a degree in Nutrition. Currently, I am taking a coding class to better my skill set for future
                employers and to hopefully have a better job outlook. Choosing this path was a full 180 degree turn as I
                have no background in this subject. I am willing to learn and master all topics the best I can to excel in
                this newfound career.
            </p1>
    
            <br><br>
    
            <p2> I was not born here in Houston, nor in the states. I come from Quezon City,
                Philippines and I moved here to the U.S. in 2003 when I was 8 years old. My parents moved here to give a
                better life to their four children. I strive to have the same integrity and patience as my parents to be
                successful. I hope that one day I can spoil them with everything that they need, since they deserve
                everything.
            </p2>
    
            <br><br>
    
            <p3>When I am not in class or at work, I like to workout at my local gym or play video games at my home. Any
                type of video game interests me, whether it would be RPG’s, MOBA’s, Open world, or Single player. One of the
                many things that interest me in coding is maybe putting my career path into game development. I might find
                something else that I like as I continue my journey, but that information will most definitely be updated in
                my portfolio when the time comes.
